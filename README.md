# Public Transport Optimization

<!-- ![Public Transport Optimization](project-image.png) -->

## Project Overview

The Public Transport Optimization project aims to enhance public transportation services by integrating IoT sensors into vehicles. These sensors track real-time location, monitor ridership, and predict arrival times, enabling the provision of accurate and up-to-the-minute transit information to passengers. The project encompasses defining objectives, designing IoT sensor systems, developing a real-time transit information platform, and integrating these components using IoT technology and Python.

## Objectives

1. **Real-time Transit Information**: Provide passengers with real-time information, including vehicle locations, estimated arrival times, and service disruptions.

2. **Arrival Time Prediction**: Develop algorithms that predict arrival times based on real-time data, traffic conditions, and historical patterns.

3. **Ridership Monitoring**: Track the number of passengers on each vehicle to optimize service allocation and enhance passenger safety.

4. **Enhanced Public Transportation Services**: Improve customer satisfaction and increase ridership by making public transportation more convenient and reliable.

## IoT Sensor Design

### Sensor Selection

- GPS Sensors: Accurately track vehicle locations in real time.
- Passenger Counters: Monitor passenger boarding and disembarking.
- Environmental Sensors (Optional): Gather data on temperature, humidity, and air quality for passenger comfort analysis.

### Data Collection

- Collect real-time GPS data to track vehicle movements.
- Continuously monitor passenger counters to update ridership data.
- Transmit data securely to the central platform for processing.

## Real-Time Transit Information Platform
